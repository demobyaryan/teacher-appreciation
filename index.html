          <p>"Some of my fondest memories of middle school took place here, and it would not have happened if Ms. Miller had not been there. she worked extremely hard to make it happen. It was instrumental in introducing kids like me to books and
            diffferent authors. It is because of her hard work and dedication that our school was able to partake in this event together. We had the oppertunity to go there before the pandemic in the 7th grade, and I enjoyed every second of it with
            my friends. Thank You Ms. Miller." - 8th grade student</p>
